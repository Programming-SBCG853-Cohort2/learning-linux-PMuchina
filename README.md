When using the terminal, we are working in a single directory.For us to explore the file and the directory, 
we use **ls** as our command. **ls** lists all the contents of the directory that we are in.
## ls

Due to the many directories that may be present in the unix command,using the **pwd** command helps you to know your location
prints the whole working directory.
## pwd 

To make a new directory, we use the make directory command.
## mkdir 

when we want to switch directories we use the change directory command.
## cd 

when navigating one level upwards a directory, we use two dots .. when navigating two levels upwards, we use two sets
of dots separated by a forward slash
## cd ..
## cd ../..

to quickly navigate from the root directory to the learning unix, use the
## ~ @ cd /

to make the ls more useful, you can use dots to list directories above you. Adding a letter l after ls gives you a longer 
output compared to default
## ls .. 
## ls ../..
## ls -1/

For every unix command, we have a manual that helps us understand how all the options function. To access this, 
we use the man command. To navigate through the man, use space to scroll down, b to go back and q to quit.
## man ls
## man cd
## man man *(even the man command has a manual)*

When we have an empty directory that we might want to remove, we use the remove directory command 
## rmdir
