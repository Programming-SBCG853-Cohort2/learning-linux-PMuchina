when using the terminal, we are working in a single directory.For us to explore the file and the directory, 
we use ls as our command.
ls
ls lists all the contents of the directory that we are in
Due to the many directories that may be present in the unix command,using the pwd command helps you to know your location
pwd prints the whole working directory
To make a new directory, we use the mkdir command
when we want to switch directories we use the cd command
